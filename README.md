# Crappy-Captions
a f*ing horrible card game

This is off Cards against Humanity, with very similar gameplay, but with .gifs instead of just text.
I don't know what I'm supposed to write here. I haven't actually deployed the code - and the base64 encoding of the gifs doesn't work quite right, so it doesn't really work yet. 
Hoping to fix it soon...
